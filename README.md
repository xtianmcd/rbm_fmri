# rbm_fmri

This is an active repo. This repo resurrects the benchmark rbm **DeepNet** (2014) and reimplements it on novel simulated fMRI data (simulated using **simTB**). The rbm weights are used to render weighted volumes representing the learned Intrinsic Network Spatial Maps. 

Next Steps:
- compare rbm performance to ICA components
- optimize the network (via hyperopt)
